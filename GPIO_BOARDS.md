Tested personally on Momentum firmware revision 007: 

* [CC1101 SubGhz 433Mhz Board](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dd17tsN)

    Works natively in the Sub-Ghz App

    Can receive signals in the general sub-ghz range, but it is advised only to send signals that are 433Mhz to reduce risk of damaging antenna and/or board.

    Even though the listing states that it can control mouses and Wi-Fi, it can really only send and transmit sub-ghz signals

    Fits well even with a case on

    A bit top heavy, and advised to 3d print a case/enclosure for it

    Demo Video coming soon
    
* [DHT11 - Temperature and Humidity sensor](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Ddo8mjr)
    
    Works with the UNITEMP flipper app but not the older DHT-Monitor app 

    PINS:
    9 (3.3v) for VCC 

    10 for SWC (data) 

    11 for Ground

    Doesn't fit well with a silicon case 

    You are better off getting a more accurate sensor (such as BMP280 or BME280), make sure itâ€™s supported by the [UNITEMP repo](https://github.com/quen0n/unitemp-flipperzero)
