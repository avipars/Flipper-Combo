Tested personally: 

* [Silicon Case](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DkhxFmp)

    - Different than the original case and works well

    - Doesn't protect/cover the 1-wire POGO pins/iButton Module

    - Case comes in different colors and has a carabiner 

* [Carrying Case](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DeGvqGp)

    - Fits the flipper and has a pocket for your USB-C Cable and some accesories

    - Mine came in the mail dirty and smelled bad, but after sticking in the washing machine and air-drying it was fine
    
* [TPU Screen Protector](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlJD7J3)

    - Only comes with a single screen protector, but buying 2 or 3 of these was cheaper than buying a set of 3 from a different seller

* [Wrist Band](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DnCnnjx)

    - Theoretically any landyard/strap with a loop will work 

    - It is a pain if you install the band before putting on the silicon case (you need to pull the band through the other side of the case)
